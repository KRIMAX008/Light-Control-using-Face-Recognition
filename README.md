# Light-Control-using-Face-Recognition
I interfaced the esp-32 cam and Arduino-uno r3 and programmed the esp-32 cam module to turn on a relay to which the external light source is connected so that it can be plugged into any power socket in the household.
This can actually be implemented in a more useful manner as a small storage room or warehouse.
